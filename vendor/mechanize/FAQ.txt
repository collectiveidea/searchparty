Q: I keep getting an EOFError:
  protocol.rb:133:in `sysread': end of file reached (EOFError)

A:  Some people have experienced an EOFError during normal mechanize usage.
    Most of the time this occurs because the remote website claims to support
    keep alives, but does not implement them correctly.  Try turning off
    keep alives on your mechanize object:

      mech.keep_alive = false
